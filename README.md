Breast Cancer Classification with CNN and ResNet
This project aims to classify breast cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ResNet, comparing their performance based on accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Overview
Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models, have shown promising results in automating the detection and classification of breast cancer from medical images.

In this project, we employ CNN and ResNet architectures to classify breast cancer from mammogram images. We evaluate the performance of both models using various metrics to determine their effectiveness in accurately diagnosing breast cancer.
